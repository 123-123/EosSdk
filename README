This package provides a self-contained implementation of stubs for the EOS
SDK.  The stubs mock how the real EOS SDK behaves on a real switch, to a
certain extent.  They are useful to build and test software in your favorite
Linux environment, with your preferred build tools.

In order to build code against the EOS SDK that can be run on EOS or vEOS,
you must build your code for i686 in a similar fashion to how build.sh builds
the stubs package, and you must link against ABI-compatible libraries.  For
instance if your code depends on OpenSSL, make sure you link against a version
that is ABI-compatible with the version bundled in EOS.
